# Security Policy

HandoffProbe is a defensive security-testing project.

## Authorized use

Use HandoffProbe only against:

- systems you own
- local fixtures and demos
- intentionally vulnerable test environments
- systems for which you have explicit authorization to perform the relevant testing

Do not use the project to disrupt, damage or access third-party systems without authorization.

## Safe defaults

The current HandoffProbe v0.4.0 release safety boundary keeps bundled active tests defaulted to local/loopback fixtures. Bundled tools must use harmless synthetic side effects wherever possible.

If remote active testing is added later, it must require explicit operator opt-in. Destructive/high-impact tests should remain disabled by default and require clear configuration plus authorization.

Test reports/evidence must redact bearer tokens, credentials and other secrets before writing them to disk or CI artifacts.

The current public Core does not make a blanket authorization to scan arbitrary
internet targets. Any future remote active-testing surface must preserve explicit
operator intent, authorization and safe defaults.

## Reporting a vulnerability in HandoffProbe

Please do not publish an unpatched vulnerability in HandoffProbe as a public issue if disclosure could put users at risk. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting / security-advisory mechanism when enabled for this repository.

A useful report includes:

- affected version/commit
- impact
- minimal reproduction
- expected vs observed behavior
- suggested mitigation if known

## Vulnerabilities found with HandoffProbe

When HandoffProbe identifies a likely vulnerability in another project:

1. verify it in an authorized environment
2. distinguish handoff/composition gap, protocol requirement, implementation bug and configuration/hardening issue
3. minimize the reproduction and remove real credentials/data
4. contact the affected maintainer privately where feasible
5. allow reasonable remediation time before publication
6. coordinate public disclosure when appropriate
7. retain a safe regression case after the issue is fixed, without embedding real secrets or unnecessary weaponized exploit material

## Research principles

- minimize harm
- avoid unnecessary access to real user data
- use synthetic data and local fixtures where possible
- make claims only when evidence is reproducible
- state protocol versions and preconditions
- distinguish protocol weakness, implementation weakness, configuration error and composition-responsibility gap
- do not overstate conformance-tool results as a security certification
- credit prior research, reporters and affected maintainers appropriately
