# Attack Catalog

This is the security-test backlog for the A2A 1.0 -> MCP 2026-07-28 handoff wedge.

IDs become stable once implemented. Every implemented test must include protocol applicability, property class, source/provenance and evidence requirements.

## Admission rule

A core test must exercise the **handoff/composition boundary**. Pure A2A or pure MCP conformance checks should remain preflight/supporting checks unless they are necessary to prove an end-to-end handoff failure.

## v0.1 P0 — implement first

### HP-AUTH-001 — Delegated authority amplification

Verify that downstream MCP capabilities/actions cannot exceed authority established by the upstream A2A task/delegation.

The stable direct `invoice.read` -> `invoice.update` mutation remains the regression anchor. Semantic evaluation is performed over concrete protected operation semantics: representation or field loss alone is not a failure, trusted downstream enforcement may preserve or narrow effective authority, and semantic widening requires at least one concrete effective downstream operation that was not permitted upstream.

Evidence includes upstream, translated and effective downstream operation sets, trusted-enforcement state, the authority relation (`equal`, `narrower` or `broader`) and concrete widening witness operations where present.

Property: composition_responsibility / spec-linked where applicable.

### HP-AUTH-002 — Missing scope fails open at handoff

Remove/omit upstream authority metadata and verify translation does not substitute a broader downstream default.

### HP-AUTH-003 — Cross-agent authorization reuse

Attempt to use authority/context bound to Agent A when the downstream handoff is acting for Agent B.

### HP-ID-001 — Original-principal continuity loss

Verify the final MCP action can still be attributed to the original authorized actor when policy requires it.

### HP-ID-002 — Agent identity substitution across translation

Replace the downstream agent identity while preserving other translated context and verify authorization does not silently survive.

### HP-TENANT-001 — Tenant context loss/substitution

Where an A2A interface declares tenant context, verify translation cannot drop/substitute it and reach a broader/different downstream MCP resource set.

### HP-TARGET-001 — Resource substitution

Keep the operation type constant but replace the target resource while reusing translated authority.

### HP-TARGET-002 — Capability/tool semantic collision

Verify similarly named upstream capability and downstream MCP tool cannot silently map to broader semantics.

### HP-APPROVAL-001 — Security-sensitive payload mutation after consent

Change a protected value (for example amount, recipient or resource) after trusted upstream approval/constraint but before MCP execution.

### HP-CRED-001 — Broad upstream credential propagation

Detect unnecessary forwarding of a broad upstream bearer credential across the handoff instead of preserving/narrowing delegated authority.

### HP-CRED-002 — Cross-audience credential acceptance

Verify a credential/token associated with one upstream/downstream audience/resource cannot be reused against another MCP target through translation.

### HP-LIFECYCLE-001 — Cancellation not propagated

Cancel/terminate the upstream A2A task before the protected MCP side effect completes and verify stale downstream execution does not occur unless explicitly allowed by semantics.

## v0.1 P1 — add after P0 engine is credible

Implementation contract:

`docs/P1_TEST_SPECIFICATION.md`

The ten IDs in this section form the locked first Phase 4 P1 corpus.

Implementation status as of 2026-08-25:

- 10 / 10 locked P1 attacks implemented
- all ten IDs are now stable
- secure and intentionally vulnerable synthetic fixtures are covered
- final Phase 4 completion remains gated on branch-wide QA, PR CI and merge

### HP-AUTH-004 — Expired delegation reuse

Attempt an action after upstream delegated authority has expired.

### HP-AUTH-005 — Delegation-chain truncation

Remove an intermediate delegation hop and verify the downstream system does not treat the shortened chain as equivalent where lineage is security-relevant.

### HP-REPLAY-001 — Exact action replay

Replay the same translated authorized action after successful consumption.

### HP-REPLAY-002 — Cross-context / cross-run replay

Reuse captured authority in a new task/run/context. This intentionally avoids the outdated assumption of an MCP protocol session in the 2026-07-28 revision.

### HP-REPLAY-003 — Retry double execution

Simulate network ambiguity/retry and verify a protected side effect is not executed twice.

### HP-APPROVAL-002 — Tool substitution after approval

Approve/authorize one upstream action and attempt a different MCP tool after translation.

### HP-APPROVAL-003 — Approval reuse for another resource

Reuse valid upstream consent against a different downstream target.

### HP-RACE-001 — Parallel one-time authority consumption

Send concurrent attempts that consume the same one-time authority.

### HP-RACE-002 — Partial-failure stale execution

Interrupt between authorization/translation/execution and verify a resumed attempt cannot use stale or ambiguous state.

### HP-AUDIT-001 — Cross-protocol audit lineage break

Verify a protected downstream side effect can be correlated to the original actor, A2A task/delegation and translated MCP request without identity collapse.

## Post-P1 stable advanced additions

The locked Phase 4 P1 corpus above remains the historical ten-ID P1 baseline. Later stable additions require a separate evidence-backed admission decision.

### HP-AUTH-006 — Stale task authorization reused for later effect

Within one task/run/context, execute one legitimately authorized protected effect, then make the governing authority non-current before a later distinct protected effect. Verify that the later effect receives a current final authorization decision before dispatch rather than inheriting the earlier task-level authorization.

Secure behavior blocks the later distinct effect before `mcp.tool.call`; the intentionally vulnerable fixture reuses the earlier authorization and executes the later effect. The two effects must remain distinct logical protected effects rather than retry attempts.

Priority: advanced. Severity: HIGH.

Admission: R4 v0.4.0 release track, derived from the separately admitted T-3 V13 research candidate. V3 remained `NO ADD`.

## Current-spec handoff backlog

These remain 2026-baseline candidates. They are not stable unless a separate normal admission demonstrates a defensible handoff-specific invariant and reproducible secure/vulnerable behavior.

### HP-STATE-001 — Explicit state-handle cross-principal reuse

MCP 2026-07-28 is stateless at protocol core, but applications may mint explicit handles. Verify a handle created downstream for one A2A principal/task cannot be reused by another merely because the handle is known.

### HP-CACHE-001 — Private capability cache crosses principal/tenant

Where MCP tool/capability lists are cached, verify the handoff layer does not reuse a private/broader cached view for a different upstream principal or tenant.

### HP-MRTR-001 — MRTR input response bound to wrong upstream task

Where a downstream MCP operation requests additional input/confirmation, verify the response is bound to the correct A2A task/principal/action.

### HP-MRTR-002 — Delayed MRTR response after upstream cancellation

Verify a delayed input/approval response cannot revive a protected MCP side effect after the governing A2A task has been cancelled or invalidated.

### HP-ROUTING-001 — Handoff-generated MCP routing metadata mismatch

Where the translation layer writes both MCP routing headers and body metadata, mutate one side and verify inconsistent method/tool/resource routing is rejected rather than authorizing a different action.

### HP-VERSION-001 — Cross-protocol version downgrade changes security semantics

Negotiate/select an older or unintended A2A/MCP behavior through the handoff and verify security-critical context is not silently lost due to version translation.

### HP-CONTENT-001 — Untrusted A2A artifact causes unauthorized tool/resource selection

Use untrusted A2A content to influence downstream selection and verify it cannot bypass trusted structured authority/resource constraints. This is a handoff-integrity test, not a generic prompt-injection score.

### HP-CARD-001 — Agent Card capability/security translation mismatch

Where handoff behavior is derived from an Agent Card, verify tampered/stale/unverified capability/security metadata cannot cause broader downstream MCP access. Pure signature validation itself remains A2A-level and should not be duplicated without a handoff consequence.

## Explicitly delegated to existing tools unless handoff-specific

Do not inflate HandoffProbe coverage with standalone checks such as:

- generic Agent Card schema conformance
- generic A2A transport MUST/SHOULD checks
- generic MCP `tools/list` / `tools/call` correctness
- generic MCP server debugging
- generic prompt injection payloads

Use/point to the official A2A TCK/Inspector and MCP Inspector for those jobs.

## Release target

v0.1 must implement at least **12 strong P0 handoff tests** with secure/vulnerable fixtures and evidence. Expand toward ~20 only when each additional test has a defensible handoff-specific invariant. Quality and reproducibility beat checklist size.
