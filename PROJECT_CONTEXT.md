# HandoffProbe — Canonical Project Context

Last updated: 2026-09-18

This file is the central context for future contributors, coding agents and project discussions.

## Mission

Build the best developer-first open-source defensive test engine for security failures created when AI-agent tasks, authority and execution context are handed across protocol boundaries.

## Product identity

- Product name: **HandoffProbe**
- Repository: `Heaviside479/handoffprobe`
- Public npm package / CLI: `handoffprobe`
- Stable test-ID prefix: `HP-`
- License: Apache-2.0

## Current public product state

- Current verified release: `handoffprobe@0.4.0`
- Stable public corpus: **23 attacks**
- Stable composition: 12 P0 + 10 P1 + 1 advanced (`HP-AUTH-006`)
- Protocol baseline: A2A 1.0 -> MCP 2026-07-28
- Report schema: `1`
- Runtime baseline: Node.js `>=24 <25`
- Public CLI: live
- Public npm package: live
- Reusable GitHub Action: live
- Commercial validation: active in parallel through the Founding Security Assessment
- Hosted Teams/Cloud product: demand-gated, not currently authorized

## Current wedge

The current public HandoffProbe Core tests **A2A 1.0 -> MCP 2026-07-28** handoffs. It does not attempt to be a generic AI-security platform or a replacement for single-protocol conformance tools.

Core question:

> When a task moves from A2A into MCP, do identity, authorization, consent, tenant, resource, lifecycle and execution constraints remain intact after translation?

## Product shape

HandoffProbe now ships as a local TypeScript CLI and reusable test engine with a source-backed GitHub Action. The open-source Core remains local-first. Hosted dashboards, customer accounts and recurring SaaS billing remain deferred until the roadmap's organization-level demand gates are satisfied.

## Handoff-specific admission rule

A HandoffProbe core test must satisfy at least one of these conditions:

1. the failure requires both sides of the handoff to be present;
2. the failure is caused by translation or propagation at the A2A -> MCP boundary;
3. the security property passes at each individual protocol layer but fails end-to-end.

Pure A2A conformance belongs primarily to the A2A TCK/Inspector. Pure MCP debugging belongs primarily to the MCP Inspector and protocol-specific security tooling. HandoffProbe may run narrow preflight checks when needed to establish a handoff test, but single-protocol validation is not the product wedge.

## Current protocol baseline

- A2A specification: released version 1.0.0 (wire compatibility version 1.0)
- MCP specification: 2026-07-28
- Initial A2A transport focus: HTTP+JSON first; JSON-RPC may follow within v0.x; gRPC is deferred until the engine is stable.
- MCP implementation work must explicitly opt into the 2026-07-28 protocol behavior when using SDKs that retain older defaults.

See `docs/RESEARCH_BASELINE.md` for authoritative sources and update policy.

## Non-negotiable constraints

1. Start with effectively zero infrastructure spend.
2. Core scanning must not require paid LLM APIs.
3. No GPU dependency.
4. Prefer deterministic security assertions over model-based judgement.
5. Keep the open-source core under Apache-2.0.
6. The current public Core scope remains centered on A2A -> MCP; additional protocol surfaces require explicit evidence-backed roadmap admission.
7. Build attack corpus, reproducibility and technical credibility before UI polish.
8. Use only systems the tester owns or is explicitly authorized to test.
9. Default active testing to local fixtures/loopback; remote active testing must require explicit opt-in if introduced.
10. Do not add cloud services, paid dependencies or recurring infrastructure without an explicit product need.
11. Every security finding should be reproducible by a minimal fixture whenever possible.
12. Every implemented attack must record protocol-version applicability and evidence/source provenance.
13. Do not claim HandoffProbe invented composition-safety research; differentiate on executable developer workflow, regression testing, evidence and real integration coverage.
14. Do not silently broaden into generic prompt-injection, MCP scanning, identity infrastructure or runtime-firewall products.
15. Do not change the HandoffProbe product/package/test-ID identity without an explicit naming decision record.

## Research position

Current 2026 research such as AgentRFC/AgentConform and AgentThread independently validates the thesis that security properties can fail under protocol composition. HandoffProbe should use that work as research context, not compete by rebuilding formal TLA+ analysis.

HandoffProbe's intended differentiation is:

- developer-first local CLI
- dynamic testing against running A2A -> MCP systems
- handoff-specific mutations and assertions
- reproducible evidence traces
- CI regression use
- a curated real-world attack corpus

## Long-term product direction

If the wedge works, expand from protocol-composition security into a broader adversarial testing platform for sensitive AI-agent handoffs, potentially including:

- human approval -> execution integrity
- agentic commerce transaction correctness
- additional protocol combinations
- CI policy gates
- enterprise reporting and governance

These are future options, not v0.1 requirements.

## Business model hypothesis

The scanner remains free and open source. Monetization should initially come from high-value services around it:

- agent handoff / protocol-composition security assessments
- custom adapters and test packs
- enterprise support

Only after real adoption should HandoffProbe consider a hosted product for team dashboards, history, scheduled scans, policy management, SSO/RBAC, compliance evidence and organization-wide integrations.

## Success signals

Early success is not defined by revenue alone. Watch for:

- repeat npm/CLI usage
- GitHub stars from real developers
- external contributors
- issues requesting framework/protocol support
- companies using HandoffProbe in CI
- a demonstrable case where individual protocol checks pass but HandoffProbe catches an end-to-end handoff failure
- responsible vulnerability disclosures or cited research
- inbound requests for audits or custom integrations

## Naming status

**Final product identity:** HandoffProbe. The repository is `handoffprobe`, the public CLI/package is `handoffprobe`, and stable test IDs use `HP-`. The earlier BridgeBreak working name was retired because of a cybersecurity naming collision. See `docs/NAMING.md`.

A formal trademark/legal review can still be performed before meaningful commercial branding spend; that does not reopen the routine product naming decision by default.

## Implementation contracts

Before implementation work, also read:

- `docs/TECHNICAL_BASELINE.md`
- `docs/P0_TEST_SPECIFICATION.md`
- `docs/FINAL_PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md`

The twelve P0 tests remain the mandatory foundational corpus. The current
verified public corpus contains 23 stable attacks: 12 P0 + 10 P1 + 1 advanced.

The existence of a working scanner, CLI and Action does not mean the mature
product roadmap is complete. `docs/FINAL_PRODUCT_DEFINITION.md` defines the
long-term product target, while `docs/ROADMAP.md` is authoritative for current
sequencing.

## Build philosophy

Small vertical slices. Test first. No speculative platform work. Do not build features merely because they might be useful later.
